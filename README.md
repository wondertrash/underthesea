# Under the Sea

Tend to your lotus plant beneath the waves.

Cast your line to reel in fish, jellyfish, and turtles. Craft bait to improve your catches, and barter to keep your plant supplied with nutrients and light. Let either run dry, and it's game over.
How many turtles can you catch before the sea claims your garden?
